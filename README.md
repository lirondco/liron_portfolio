## My Portfolio's Repo!

Portfolio site: https://www.lirondc.com

### About this website

This is the repo that is the backbone of my personal portfolio website.

This website was created using ReactJS with Hooks plus Helmet for adding custom titles and meta descriptions for each page of the portfolio. 

The portfolio page is available in both English and Hebrew.

### User Story

The user can look at it and think it's cool, view my projects, read more about myself, then click that contact button to reach out to me and ask me to join their team.
